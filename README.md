## 🧠 Overview

**AutoCAD Express Tools** is a built-in extension package for AutoCAD that expands the standard drafting environment with a wide range of additional commands and utilities. These tools are designed to simplify everyday CAD tasks and reduce the time spent on repetitive manual operations.

The extension focuses on practical enhancements such as advanced text handling, efficient layer operations, block and attribute management, and drawing cleanup functions. By integrating directly into the AutoCAD interface, Express Tools feel like a natural part of the workflow rather than a separate add-on.

AutoCAD Express Tools are commonly used by professionals working with complex drawings, large project files, and standardized documentation. They help maintain consistency, improve accuracy, and accelerate drafting across architectural, engineering, and construction projects.
